I moved to the Chattanooga area in 2016 with my now husband and two rescue dogs (Sadie and the Bandit). In 2022 we will be welcoming a new member to our family! I originally graduated college with a performing arts degree and pursued a career in dance. When I moved here from New York, I decided to change career paths. I started at The Strand as a receptionist and soon decided hair was my next creative path. I truly enjoy every aspect of hair coloring, cutting, and styling. I would love to have you in my chair!</p>

We love to travel, try new foods, and spend time with our family and friends. We opened The Strand Salon in 2013 with the desire to have a planet-friendly salon that gives back to its stylists, clients, and the community. I love training others as well as continuing my own training and education so that I can provide my clients with the best options for their hair. I want every client leaving our salon to look and feel his or her absolute best!</p>

I am happily married and we have a beautiful daughter named Eliza, with another baby on the way in March 2018! I absolutely love being a mom and spending time with my family. My passion is doing hair though. There is no force in the world that could take me away from it. I enjoy doing everything from men’s and women’s cuts to balyage and gorgeous single colors. One of the best parts of my job is helping people be confident and feel better. I would love to give you that wonderful feeling that so many of my clients experience when getting their hair done!</p>

					  <p class="card-text">My name is Ashley McAllister. I was born and raised in Ringgold, Georgia. I am the Georgia peach of the group. I am happily married and we have the most precious little boy. I have been doing hair since 2006. I chose to assist my first year out of school so that I could sharpen and perfect my skills before I stated building my own clientele. It was an amazing and challenging opportunity and I know it has shaped me to be the hair designer I am today. I absolutely love my job. I enjoy cutting and coloring for a wide-ranging clientele. I work with men, women, and children with all types of hair. However, most of my co-workers say I am a blonde specialist. I push myself to always be on top of today’s fashions and styles. I love continuing education so that I can be the best hair designer I can be. I take pride in my work and my main goal is to help my clients feel like a million bucks when they walk out the door.</p>

					  <p class="card-text">From the time I grew up in Soddy-Daisy, I knew that doing hair was going to be my career, and so did my family and my first client Barbie. I started my career in downtown Chattanooga. The hustle and bustle were just what I was looking for. I’ve been doing hair for over a decade and my passion only continues to grow. Two things fuel my enthusiasm, education and client satisfaction. Education is key to staying in the loop with new techniques and tweaking what I’ve learned through experience so I attend as many classes and shows as I can. I pride myself on working hard to stay on “the cutting edge.” I am motivated to make all my clients love the way they look, and as a mom myself, I enjoy the chance to pamper other moms. We need it! Hair color is my favorite, but I am fortunate to be able to do it all whether it’s cutting a new style, men’s cuts, or a whole new “do.” I can’t imagine doing anything else because hair is what I love! I enjoy family time, hiking, and water sports with my husband and daughter. I would appreciate the opportunity to get to know you and take care of your hair needs.</p>

					  <h5 class="card-title">Tracy Fiore, Stylist</h5>
					  <p class="card-text">I was born and raised in South Florida. I enjoyed varied careers ranging from graphic design to entertainment before moving to Georgia in 2004. There I began my cosmetology apprenticeship in 2008 earning my master cosmetologist license before venturing north to Chattanooga in 2011. My passion is for vibrantly colored hair and varied fantasy colors, which have become my specialty. If you enjoy a more subdued palette I use advanced techniques like balayage, flamboyage, ecaille, ombre, or classic foil highlights to create dimensional color. From long layers to a pixie, a great haircut is the foundation. Shiny, healthy hair with styles that you can recreate at home is always the most important way to ensure you look and feel your best. To help better our community I do volunteer haircuts for Room at the Inn, which houses victims of domestic violence. I am also on the board of Beauty &amp; Soul in Georgia, which provides underprivileged adolescent girls with school supplies and back to school haircuts. I live in a madhouse run by an army of tiny tyrants of my own making. I enjoy spending time with said tyrants and our three cats. My oldest son attends CSAS, plays competitive travel soccer, and enjoys rock climbing.  My youngest son is learning the sport of fencing (I make a pitiable attempt to learn along with him but mostly just end up with a lot of bruises, both physical and to my ego). My daughter enjoys soccer, dance, and generally making me and my partner Jesse question all our life choices. In my non-existent spare time my interests include writing, photography, knitting, feeble attempts at organic gardening, jewelry design, as well as kiln-fusing and flameworking glass.</p>

					  <p class="card-text">Most people call me Debbie. I am a true southern girl from Ringgold, Georgia. I recently married my best friend who is pursuing his dream to become a barber. We both have so much love for the hair industry. We have a beautiful young daughter named Aavah. I’m proud to say I’ve been doing hair since 2013. It all started with an amazing apprenticeship that made my passion for hair grow. I really enjoy getting to know people and helping them with their hair needs, whether its style coaching them or educating them on the right hair products. Details also give me great satisfaction whether it’s color placement or fresh crisp lines on a haircut; it’s the little things that make a difference. I strive to do my best and to be the stylist I would want if I were you.</p>
