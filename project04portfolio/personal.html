	  <h1>Personal Development program</h1>
	  <p>At the Girls &#38; Boys Club, we try to offer programs to fill the gaps that are not being addressed in many inner-city public schools. We offer volunteer-led classes in a number of fields, including:</p>		  
		  <ul>
		    <li><strong>Smart Girls</strong> - A health, fitness, prevention/education and self-esteem enhancement program for girls ages 8 to 17.</li>
		    <li><strong>Triple Play</strong> - Emphasizes good nutrition, regular physical activity, and improving overall well-being.</li>
		    <li><strong>Goals For Graduation</strong> - Designed to enhance Club members&#8217; engagement with learning by providing consistent support from caring and trusted adults in developing the academic, emotional and social skills needed to achieve academic success.</li>
		    <li><strong>Money Matters</strong> - Promotes financial responsibility and independence among Club members. Participants learn how to manage a checking account, create a budget, save and invest, and pay for college.</li>
		    <li><strong>Image Makers</strong> - Encourages Club members to learn about black-and-white, color, digital and alternative process photography. The ImageMakers National Photography Program Resource Guide is full of fun, creative activity ideas</li>
		    <li><strong>Fine Arts Exhibit</strong> - Encourages artistic expression among Club members through drawing, painting, printmaking, collage, mixed media and sculpture displayed at local and regional exhibits.</li>
			<li><strong>Drama Matters</strong> - A drama education program that encourages Club members ages 6 to 18 to engage in hands-on activities. Drama education builds self-confidence, sparks creativity and boosts academic achievement.</li>
			<li><strong>Keystone Club</strong> - A unique teen leadership development experience provides opportunities for young people aged 14&#8211;18.</li>
		    <li><strong>Family Plus</strong> - Enables Clubs to partner with families and collaborate with other community agencies to ensure the positive development of youth through programming, resources and support. <br>
	        There is no cost to attend, and all necessary materials will be provided.</li>
      </ul>
