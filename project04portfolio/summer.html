	  <h1>Summer Tutoring program</h1>
	  <p>Many students have a difficult time retaining their studies through several months of summer break. The Girls &amp; Boys Club offers tutoring in a number of subjects, including basic math, algebra, reading comprehension, and writing skills.</p>
		<p>Tutoring groups meet for one hour, in groups of no more than five Club members. All tutors are volunteers who have been certified by the State Board of Education. There is no cost for small-group tutoring services, although spaces are limited. Private tutoring is also available at a minimal cost (or in exchange for volunteer work at the Club facility). </p>
